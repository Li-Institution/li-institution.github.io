        <main>
            <p>
                We are a small, non-profit organization that likes making open-sourced
                software! Everything that we make here is free and open sourced except
                for a few small exceptions (like the can pooper bot).
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Li Institution was originally created back in May 2022 by <strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]</strong> and Neng Li. Anthony Huang joined soon afterwards.
                When it was first created, the Li Institution had no specific goals or objectives, and it does not right now either. We're just
                a bunch of people like you and me, making open-sourced software and apps because we wanted to!
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            
            <p>
                As stated before, we have no specific missions or political agenda, and we currently do not have any visions for the future either.
                All we're doing right now is just writing code, and not much else. Though, I'm hoping to get some moderately sophisticated projects,
                like a game engine or a basic desktop application, a decent website, or even an entire operating system (NengOS üôÄ))
            </p>
            
            <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
            
            <p>
                We are currently specialized in just a few programming languages, including:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                    <li>C/C++</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
