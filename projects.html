                <h2>Can Pooper</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the first Discord bots that was created by a Li Institution member that still exists,
                    Can Pooper is one of the messiest Li Institution codebases that is still considered active and alive.
                    Besides being messy and badly architectured, Can Pooper does not possess any specific purposes and is
                    mainly created for the purpose of amusement. It is written in Python (check out the source <a href="https://github.com/carpetmaker3162/can-pooper-bot">here</a>). You can also check out its features by joining the Li Institution Discord server.

                <h2>Chess Program</h2>
                <p>
                    A simple chess program written in C++. It is currently not finished, but you can still check it out
                    <a href = "https://github.com/hello56721/chess">here</a>. Besides the CMake build scripts and the GLSL
                    shaders, it is written completely in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering. It uses the GLFW library for window
                    and context creation, and uses GLAD for loading OpenGL functions. Like Can Pooper, it does not possess good 
                    software architecturing, but unlike Can Pooper, it has some kind of architecture whereas Can Pooper is just a bunch
                    of program flow control statements.

                <h2>FHDBot</h2>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, this Discord bot is created by Anthony Huang. Like Can Pooper, it currently possesses no specific purpose 
                    and is mainly created for amusement purposes. As a result, like Can Pooper, it's code architecture isn't exactly the best and likely has
                    a few hidden bugs throughout the codebase. It is written in JavaScript and uses the Discord.js library for interacting with 
                    the Discord API. You can check it out <a href = "https://github.com/anthonyhuang07/fhdbot">here</a> or by joining the Li Institution Discord 
                    Server.
